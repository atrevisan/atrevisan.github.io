I'm a software developer engaged in the development of solution for various platforms and programming languages.
My main interests concentrate in the development of web and desktop applications with the .NET platform. I have
experience in the software industry, where i worked in a company that develops custom solutions for companies
of various segments. In this company i participated into two projects of systems that are used by the air 
transportation industry. Throughout my time in university i participated in a scientic internship programe
into a public reasearch institute. In this institution i worked in a Artificial Inteligence laboratory where
i developed a project in which i developed applications that integrated a multiagents plataform with a 
project manah=gement system. In university i also participated in the tutoring educational programe. This
programe was about the development of activities related to teatching, research and extension. One of the 
projects developed at the time was the elaboration of a course in the C programming language for the
students in the eletronics and informatics departaments. Nowadays i'm working as a freelance developer.

### Degree
Undergrad: Bachelor in Information Systems.  
Institution: [Federal University of Technology - Paraná] (http://utfpr.edu.br/).

### Professional experience

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from January 2014 to May 2014).  
**Project:** The system SITA-Insight from SITA is a system with the goal of monitoring the air fare
marked and to detect changes in prices, availability and to manage the air fares creation and 
modification workflow in response to changes in the market, aiding companies to deal with the 
complexity of the air industry business rules and to analyse the big load of data from competitors
comming from the ATPCO (Airline Tariff Publishing Company) feed, the fares distribution standard
for the american market. The project was developed in Java, EJB's, Java Swing with JBuilder in the
client side and weblogic applications server. It was a project between Brazil and Canada, and the
majority of actities was developed in a virttualized environment.  
**Activities:**  
- To use the Eclipse IDE.  
- Bug fixing and development of new features.  
- Development of webservices.  
- To use Quality Center for bug tracking.  
- Criation and execution of test scenarios.  
- To use SVN version control system.

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from February 2013 to December 2013).  
**Project:** The SITATEX IP system from SITA is a messages client based in the type b protocol and
used by the air transportation industry, with a base of more than 20.000 instalations. The system
comunicates with the SITATEX server deplyed into two data centers. It is a Windows based applications
that was developed for the last 20 years (with a DOS version in the beginning) and in 2010 ported 
for Windows 7, receiving improovements since then. The applications was developed above the .NET
platform with the use of C++, C# and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). The project was developed
with the SCRUM methodology, with the stuff working from the US, France and Brazil.  
**Activities:**  
- To use the Visual Studio IDE.  
- Bug fixing and the development of new features.  
- To use the JIRA project management tool.  
- Creation and execution of test cenarios.  
- To use SVN version control system.  
- To interact with the Quality Assurance team from Atlanta.  
- To manage configurations and build distribution to the SITA team of operations.  
- Documentation updates.

**Company:** Paraná Institute of Technology (TECPAR) (from september 2011 to august 2012).

####Common Lisp developer, [Paraná Institute of Technology] (http://tecpar.br)
- Scientific internship program participation.
- Developed a project in the area of multiagent systems applied to the management of
small teams of engineers.
- The project main goal was to use agent based technology as a tool for interfacing 
and integrating already existent project management tools. More details [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp)
- I used the Franz Alegro Common Lisp environment.
- I have also participated in a seminary where i presented the project "The use of a multiagent platform based in 
Common Lisp for aiding in project management".

####Participation in the Education Tutoring program in my University, Federal University of Technology - Paraná
- I helped in the organization and teatching of a course in the [C programming language] (http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/petcoce/galeria-de-fotos/curso-de-c).
- I helped in the organization and teatching of a course that helped teatchers from the public school basic system
from my city to learn how to use software for writing academic articles.
- I also helped in the organization of the eletronics and informatics week that happen in the university once a year.


As my undergrad final project i worked with machine learning, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. I built a tool based in Python and Scikit-learn that performs Twitter data exploration and analysis, you can find more about it [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/twitter_analysis). Other area that i have explored a little bit in university and i think is worth mentioning is Computer Vision, i built a cat/dog image classifier using OpenCV and Support Vector Machines, you can take a look [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/ImageClassifier). Ps: the code is a bit messy.

During university i have also engaged myself in a scientific internship at the [Paraná Institute of Technology] (http://http://www.tecpar.br/). There i worked at the Center of Engineering for Inteligent Systems. I developed a project in the area of multiagent systems where i used a Common Lisp based plataform for building agents that aid in the management process of projects of small teams of engineers. I used the Allegro Common Lisp environment, you can take a look at the project [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp). 

I have also worked at a Software factory company that build applications suitable for the needs of companies. There i worked in two projects:

- The first one was a messages client based on the [type b protocol] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443) used by the air transportation industry. In the project i used mainly managed C++, MFC, Visual Studio and a bit of C#. The project was developed using the SCRUM metodology and the main tasks were about code maintenance.

- The second project was a system for monitoring the air fare market for detecting changes in fare prices and availability, aiding in the air companies workflow with the process of creating and changing fares in response to the market. The main technologies used were Java, EJBs and Eclipse, using Java Swing and JBuilder at the client side, and Weblogic applications server and webservices.
 
Curently my main area of interest is the web. I'm focused in the development of asp.net mvc applications at the server side and the use of Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS and other sorts of client frameworks.
