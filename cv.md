## Allan Caminha Trevisan

A software developer engaged in developing solutions for various plataforms and programming languages. Currently my
main interests lie in web development using the .net framework and Javascript. I have experience in the software industry,
where i worked in a company that builds customized applications and offer coding services for other companies. There i worked 
in two projects related to the air transportation industry. During university i have also engaged myself in a scientific internship
at a research institution, there i worked at the Center of Engineering for Inteligent Systems where i developed a project in the 
area of multiagent systems. During university i have also participated in the educational tutoring program where we developed 
activities related to teatching, research and extension.

### Degree
Bachelor in Information Systems. [Federal University of Technology - Paran치] (http://utfpr.edu.br/).

### Professional experience
####C++ and C# developer, Cinq Technologies
- Maintenance for a messages client system based on the type b protocol used in the air cargo industry.
- Bug fixes and development of new features.
- Organization of meetings and use of SCRUM metodology.
- Creation and execution of test scenarios.
- Aplication developed using MFC.

####Java developer, Cinq technologies
- Maintenance for an air fare market monitoring system.
- Bug fixes and development of new features.
- Development of EJB's and webservices.
- Use of the qc bug tracking software.
- Creation and execution of test scenarios.
- Development environment running in a virtualized platform.

####Common Lisp developer, [Paran치 Institute of Technology] (http://tecpar.br)
- Scientific internship program participation.
- Developed a project in the area of multiagent systems applied to the management of
small teams of engineers.
- The project main goal was to use agent based technology as a tool for interfacing 
and integrating already existent project management tools. More details [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp)
- I used the Franz Alegro Common Lisp environment.
- I have also participated in a seminary where i presented the project "The use of a multiagent platform based in 
Common Lisp for aiding in project management".

####Participation in the Education Tutoring program in my University, Federal University of Technology - Paran치
- I helped in the organization and teatching of a course in the [C programming language] (http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/petcoce/galeria-de-fotos/curso-de-c).
- I helped in the organization and teatching of a course that helped teatchers from the public school basic system
from my city to learn how to use software for writing academic articles.
- I also helped in the organization of the eletronics and informatics week that happen in the university once a year.


As my undergrad final project i worked with machine learning, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. I built a tool based in Python and Scikit-learn that performs Twitter data exploration and analysis, you can find more about it [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/twitter_analysis). Other area that i have explored a little bit in university and i think is worth mentioning is Computer Vision, i built a cat/dog image classifier using OpenCV and Support Vector Machines, you can take a look [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/ImageClassifier). Ps: the code is a bit messy.

During university i have also engaged myself in a scientific internship at the [Paran치 Institute of Technology] (http://http://www.tecpar.br/). There i worked at the Center of Engineering for Inteligent Systems. I developed a project in the area of multiagent systems where i used a Common Lisp based plataform for building agents that aid in the management process of projects of small teams of engineers. I used the Allegro Common Lisp environment, you can take a look at the project [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp). 

I have also worked at a Software factory company that build applications suitable for the needs of companies. There i worked in two projects:

- The first one was a messages client based on the [type b protocol] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443) used by the air transportation industry. In the project i used mainly managed C++, MFC, Visual Studio and a bit of C#. The project was developed using the SCRUM metodology and the main tasks were about code maintenance.

- The second project was a system for monitoring the air fare market for detecting changes in fare prices and availability, aiding in the air companies workflow with the process of creating and changing fares in response to the market. The main technologies used were Java, EJBs and Eclipse, using Java Swing and JBuilder at the client side, and Weblogic applications server and webservices.
 
Curently my main area of interest is the web. I'm focused in the development of asp.net mvc applications at the server side and the use of Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS and other sorts of client frameworks.
