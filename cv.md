I'm a software developer engaged in the development of solution for various platforms and programming languages.
My main interests concentrate in the development of web and desktop applications with the .NET platform. I have
experience in the software industry, where i worked in a company that develops custom solutions for companies
of various segments. In this company i participated into two projects of systems that are used by the air 
transportation industry. Throughout my time in university i participated in a Scientific internship programe
into a public research institute. In this institute i worked in an Artificial Intelligence laboratory where
i developed a project in which i developed applications that integrated a multiagents platform with a 
project management system. In university i also participated in the tutoring educational programe. This
programe was about the development of activities related to teaching, research and extension. One of the 
projects developed at the time was the elaboration of a course in the C programming language for the
students in the electronics and informatics departments. Nowadays i'm working as a freelance developer.

### Degree
Undergrad: Bachelor in Information Systems.  
Institution: [Federal University of Technology - Paraná] (http://utfpr.edu.br/).

### Professional experience

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from January 2014 to May 2014).  
**Project:** The system SITA-Insight from SITA is a system with the goal of monitoring the air fare
marked and to detect changes in prices, availability and to manage the air fares creation and 
modification workflow in response to changes in the market, aiding companies to deal with the 
complexity of the air industry business rules and to analyse the big load of data from competitors
coming from the ATPCO (Airline Tariff Publishing Company) feed, the fares distribution standard
for the american market. The project was developed in Java, EJB's, Java Swing with JBuilder in the
client side and weblogic applications server. It was a project between Brazil and Canada, and the
majority of activities was developed in a virtual environment.
**Activities:**  

* To use the Eclipse IDE.  
* Bug fixing and development of new features.  
* Development of webservices.  
* To use Quality Center for bug tracking.  
* Creation and execution of test scenarios.  
* To use SVN version control system.

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from February 2013 to December 2013).  
**Project:** The SITATEX IP system from SITA is a messages client based in the type b protocol and
used by the air transportation industry, with a base of more than 20.000 installations. The system
communicates with the SITATEX server deployed into two data centers. It is a Windows based applications
that was developed for the last 20 years (with a DOS version in the beginning) and in 2010 ported 
to Windows 7, receiving improvements since then. The applications was developed above the .NET
platform with the use of C++, C# and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). The project was developed
with the SCRUM methodology, with the members working from the US, France and Brazil.  
**Activities:**

* To use the Visual Studio IDE.  
* Bug fixing and the development of new features.  
* To use the JIRA project management tool.  
* Creation and execution of test scenarios.  
* To use SVN version control system.  
* To interact with the Quality Assurance team from Atlanta.  
* To manage configurations and build distribution to the SITA team of operations.  
* Documentation updates.

**Company:** Paraná Institute of Technology (TECPAR) (from September 2011 to August 2012).  
**Project:** The OMAS (Open Multiagent Systems) platform is a multiagent platform used for building
distributed applications that need complex cognitive agents with a flexible human interface. The 
platform was developed in Common Lisp by professor Jean Paul Barthès in the university of 
Compiègne. The project main goal was to use the platform to build software agents that are capable
of communicate with an already existent project management tool that is been used at the Center
for Intelligent Systems Engineering in TECPAR.  
**Activities:**

* My participation in the project was made possible through the scientific internship program from the Araucaria Foundation.
* Programming software agents in Common Lisp.
* To create SQL queries for the MySQL database used by the project management tool.
* One kind of agent developed is the service agent which responsibility is to monitor the tool and generate reports.
* I participated in the institute techno scientific seminaries in which i presented the project with the title "The use of a Common Lisp based multiagent platform for aiding in project management".
* More details about the project can be found [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp).

**Company:** Federal University of Technology - Paraná (from July 2010 to July 2011).  
**Project:** Participation in the educational tutoring program of the Information System course. In this project
the participants developed activities related to teaching. research and extension through the interaction
between the communities internal and external to the university.  
**Activities:**

* Participation in the conceptualization and presentation of a course in the C programming language for the students of the electronics and informatics departments.
* Participation in the organization of the electronics and informatics week that happen every year at the university.
* Participation in the conceptualization and presentation of a course about the use of informational tools for the elaboration of research papers to the teachers of the external public system.
* Install and configuration of the Plone CMS to be used as a portal to the electronics and informatics week.
 
### Skills

- **Programming languages:** Java, Javascript, C, C++, C#, Python, Lisp.
- **Version control:** SVN (Tortoise SVN), Git (Tortoise Git).
- **Web:** ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web api, HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, JQuerry, Bootstrap.
- **Databases:** PostgresSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.
- **Unit testing:** Test driven development.

### Personal Projects

* As my undergrad final project i worked with machine learning, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. I built a tool based in Python and Scikit-learn that performs Twitter data exploration and analysis, you can find more about it [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/twitter_analysis). 
* Other area that i have explored a little bit in university and i think is worth mentioning is Computer Vision, i built a cat/dog image classifier using OpenCV and Support Vector Machines, you can take a look [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/ImageClassifier).
* Currently i'm studing about the architecture of web based game engines.

### Certification

* Webdesign, Opetwork (2007).
* Hardware maintenance, Opetwork (2006).

### Languages

* English: advanced.
