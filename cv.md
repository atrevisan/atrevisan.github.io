I'm a software developer engaged in the creation of solutions for various platforms and programming languages.
Currently my main programming interests lie in the development of business web applications with
the .NET platform and frontend frameworks. I have experience in the software industry working in a company 
that develops custom solutions for various segments. 
In this company i worked into two projects maintaining systems for the air 
transportation industry. Throughout my time as a student at university i joined a Scientific internship program
into a public research institute. In this internship i worked into an Artificial Intelligence laboratory developing
a project that integrated a multiagent platform with a project management system in operation. As a student 
i also joined a tutoring educational program in my university where i developed activities related to teaching, research and extension. 
One of the projects developed at the time was the elaboration of a course in the C programming language for the
students of the electronics and informatics departments. Nowadays i'm working as a freelancer developer.

### Degree
Bachelor in Information Systems.  
Institution: [Federal University of Technology - Paraná] (http://utfpr.edu.br/).

### Professional experience

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from January 2014 to May 2014).  
**Project description:** The main goals of the SITA-Insight system are monitoring the air fares
marked for detecting changes in prices, availability and to help managing the air fares creation and 
modification workflow in response to changes in the market. The system help companies to deal with the 
complexity of the air industry business rules and to analyse the big load of data from competitors
coming from the application feed. The project was developed in Java, EJB's, Java Swing with JBuilder in the
client side and weblogic applications server. It was a project between Brazil and Canada, and the
majority of activities were developed in a virtualized environment.

**Activities developed:**  

* Bug fixing and development of new features.  
* Development of webservices.  
* To use Quality Center for bug tracking.  
* Creation and execution of test scenarios.  
* To use SVN version control system for code management.

**Company:** CINQ Technologies (from February 2013 to December 2013).  
**Project description:** The SITATEX-IP system is a messages client based on the type b protocol and
used by the air transportation industry, with a base of more than 20.000 installations. The system
communicates with the SITATEX server deployed into two data centers. It is a Windows based application
developed for the last 20 years (with a DOS version at the beginning) and in 2010 ported 
to Windows 7, receiving improvements since then. The application was developed on the .NET
platform with the use of C++, C# and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). The project was developed
using the SCRUM methodology, with the project members working from the US, France and Brazil.  

**Activities developed:**

* Bug fixing and the development of new features.  
* To use the JIRA project management tool.  
* Creation and execution of test scenarios.  
* To use SVN version control system for code management.  
* To interact with the Quality Assurance team from Atlanta.  
* To manage configurations and build distribution to the SITA operations team.  
* Documentation updates.

**Company:** Paraná Institute of Technology (TECPAR) (from September 2011 to August 2012).  
**Project description:** The OMAS (Open Multiagent System) platform is a multiagent platform used for building
distributed applications in need of complex cognitive agents provided with a flexible human interface. The 
platform was developed in Common Lisp by professor Jean Paul Barthès at the university of 
Compiègne. There i worked as an intern in the Artificial Intelligence lab building software agents that
communicate to an already operational project management tool.  

**Activities developed:**

* Programming software agents in Common Lisp.
* To build SQL queries for the MySQL database used by the project management tool.
* One kind of agent developed is the service agent, its responsibility is to monitor the tool and generate reports.
* I participated in the institute techno scientific seminary where i presented my project. I submitted a paper with the title "The use of a Common Lisp based multiagent platform for aiding in project management".
* More details about the project can be found [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp).

**Company:** Federal University of Technology - Paraná (from July 2010 to July 2011).  
**Project description:** Participation in the educational tutoring program in the informatics department. In this project
the participants developed activities related to teaching. research and extension through the interaction
between the communities internal and external to the university.  

**Activities developed:**

* Participation in the conceptualization and presentation of a course in the C programming language for the students of the electronics and informatics departments.
* Participation in the organization of the electronics and informatics week that happen every year at the university.
* Participation in the conceptualization and presentation of a course about the use of informational tools for the elaboration of research projects to the teachers from the external public system.
* Install and configuration of the Plone CMS used by the group in various projects.
 
### Skills

- **Programming languages:** Java, Javascript, C, C++, C#, Python, Lisp.
- **Version control:** SVN (Tortoise SVN), Git (Tortoise Git).
- **Web:** ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web api, HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, JQuerry, Bootstrap.
- **Visual Studio:** Nuget packages manager.
- **Databases:** PostgresSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.
- **Unit testing:** Test driven development.

### Personal Projects

* As my undergrad final project i worked with machine learning, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. I've built a tool based in Python, Scikit-learn and NLTK for performing Twitter data exploration and analysis, you can find more about it [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/twitter_analysis). 
* Other area that i have explored a little bit in university and i think is worth mentioning is Computer Vision, i built a cat/dog image classifier using OpenCV and Support Vector Machines, you can take a look [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/ImageClassifier).
* Currently i'm studying about the architecture of web based game engines.
* I'm also contributing to the NugetGallery project, the nuget packages backend. 

### Certification

* Webdesign, Opetwork (2007).
* Hardware maintenance, Opetwork (2006).

### Languages

* English: advanced.
