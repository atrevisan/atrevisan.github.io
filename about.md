Finally i managed to put this blog online. Hi there!!! My name is Allan Trevisan, i'm a software developer and i was born in the southern tip of Brazil in [Curitiba] (https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Curitiba+-+PR/@-25.446972,-49.245023,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U!2e4!3e12!6s%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U%2Fs203-k-no%2F!7i2816!8i2112!4m2!3m1!1s0x94dce3f5fc090ff1:0x3c7a83b0092bb747!6m1!1e1?hl=pt-BR) Paraná. I have a bachelor degree in Information Systems from the [Federal University of Technology - Paraná] (http://www.utfpr.edu.br/). Software development and programming are some of my main areas of interest, one of the coolest things i think about programming is that you are able to build things and see the imediate result of your craft. I'm also a big fan of cats as i have [two of them] (/images/2015-05-09%2012.03.40.jpg). Besides that i also like to practice some cycling regularly  at the [Barigui park] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_Barigui). My favorite literary genres are scifi and horror and my favorite authors are Isac Azimov and HP Lovecraft. I look like this:

As my undergrad final project i worked with machine learning, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. I built a tool based in Python and Scikit-learn that performs Twitter data exploration and analysis, you can find more about it [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/twitter_analysis). Other area that i have explored a little bit in university and i think is worth mentioning is Computer Vision, i built a cat/dog image classifier using OpenCV and Support Vector Machines, you can take a look [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/ImageClassifier). Ps: the code is a bit messy.

During university i have also engaged myself in a scientific internship at the [Paraná Institute of Technology] (http://http://www.tecpar.br/). There i worked at the Center of Engineering for Inteligent Systems. I developed a project in the area of multiagent systems where i used a Common Lisp based plataform for building agents that aid in the management process of projects of small teams of engineers. I used the Allegro Common Lisp environment, you can take a look at the project [here] (https://github.com/atrevisan/MultiagentsLisp). 

I have also worked at a Software factory company that build applications suitable for the needs of companies. There i worked in two projects:

- The first one was a messages client based on the [type b protocol] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443) used by the air transportation industry. In the project i used mainly managed C++, MFC, Visual Studio and a bit of C#. The project was developed using the SCRUM metodology and the main tasks were about code maintenance.

- The second project was a system for monitoring the air fare market for detecting changes in fare prices and availability, aiding in the air companies workflow with the process of creating and changing fares in response to the market. The main technologies used were Java, EJBs and Eclipse, using Java Swing and JBuilder at the client side, and Weblogic applications server and webservices.
 
Curently my main area of interest is the web. I'm focused in the development of asp.net mvc applications at the server side and the use of Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS and other sorts of client frameworks.
