Finally i managed to put this blog online. Hi there!!! My name is Allan Trevisan, i'm a software developer, i was born in the southern tip of Brazil in [Curitiba] (https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Curitiba+-+PR/@-25.446972,-49.245023,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U!2e4!3e12!6s%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U%2Fs203-k-no%2F!7i2816!8i2112!4m2!3m1!1s0x94dce3f5fc090ff1:0x3c7a83b0092bb747!6m1!1e1?hl=pt-BR) Paraná. I have a bachelor degree in Information Systems from the [federal university of technology - paraná] (http://www.utfpr.edu.br/). I love programming and solving problems, i think the satisfaction of finishing a project and looking back to the result of your work is absolutly amazing, as programmers are doers like artists, they have the privilege of seeing the direct result of their craft. I'm also a big fan of cats as i have [two of them] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/2eeuk7k14pukvo6/2015-05-09%2012.03.40.jpg?dl=0). Besides that i like to practice runs at the [Barigui park] (https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Parque+Barigui,+Curitiba+-+PR/@-25.4249682,-49.3128316,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-fkD6PdUPF1I%2FVn3e35n-jVI%2FAAAAAAAAMN4%2FGj6cOzFtfME!2e4!3e12!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F-fkD6PdUPF1I%2FVn3e35n-jVI%2FAAAAAAAAMN4%2FGj6cOzFtfME%2Fs114-k-no%2F!7i2592!8i1944!4m2!3m1!1s0x94dce3d8762c9e71:0x5628b5d28d45bd5b!6m1!1e1?hl=pt-BR) wherei live close to, and i'm also a big fan of horror stories, my favorite author is HP Lovecraft.
