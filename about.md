Finally i managed to put this blog online. Hi there!!! My name is Allan Trevisan, i'm a software developer and i was born in the southern tip of Brazil in [Curitiba] (https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Curitiba+-+PR/@-25.446972,-49.245023,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U!2e4!3e12!6s%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F-Z7VemrapwQk%2FTfvW04FPT6I%2FAAAAAAAAMfQ%2F6tLj2wjEP_U%2Fs203-k-no%2F!7i2816!8i2112!4m2!3m1!1s0x94dce3f5fc090ff1:0x3c7a83b0092bb747!6m1!1e1?hl=pt-BR) Paraná. I have a bachelor degree in Information Systems from the [Federal University of Technology - Paraná] (http://www.utfpr.edu.br/). Software development and programming are some of my main areas of interest, one of the coolest things i think about programming is that you are able to build things. How cool is that? You are able to  see the imediate result of your craft, few professions have this privilege. I'm also a big fan of cats as i have [two of them] (/images/2015-05-09%2012.03.40.jpg). Besides all of that one of my hobbies is to ride my bike from time to time at the [Barigui park] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_Barigui). My favorite literary genres are scifi and horror and my favorite authors are Isac Azimov and HP Lovecraft. I look like this:

I have programmed already in a bunch of languages: C++, Python, C#, Java, Common Lisp, Javascript, ... Currently my main area of interest is web development with the asp.net mvc framework and another bunch of Javascript frontend frameworks. I have also a deep interest in game programming, mainly in the field of game engine architecture. In the moment i'm learning how to develop a 2d web engine. In the future i plan to dive deeper into WebGL as my current knowledge is still pretty basic. I have also played a little bit with the Unity engine in the past but i'm more into programming them game design actually. I have build this blog with the idea to write some articles and tutorials about technologies i think are interesting or at least useful for me and also with the intent to build a web presence for myself.
